# JavaScript Memory Model

## What is Memory?
> Memory is the space where the variable or value is stored. In other words, when your code is executed. I want you to think that your declared variables, functions, and statements are contained somewhere. This somewhere is known as a memory.

## Memory Model
> JavaScript has three portions of memory assigned to a program during execution. These combined together is known as the **Address Space** of the program.
1.	**Code Area:** <br>
This is the area the JS code to be executed is stored.
2.	**Call Stack:** <br>
This area keeps track of currently executing functions, perform computation and store local variables. The variables are stored in the stack in a **LIFO method**. The last one in is the first out. Value data types are stored here.
3.	**Heap:** <br>
This is where JavaScript reference data types like objects are allocated. Unlike stack, memory allocation is randomly placed, no LIFO policy. And to prevent memory “holes” in the Heap, the JS engine has memory managers that prevent them from occurring.

`Example)` <br>
corn and lion values are stored in the stack during execution.
```JavaScript
let corn = 95
let lion = 100
```

`Example)`<br>
lion and tiger are reference types, their values are stored in the Heap and they are pushed to the stack. Their values in stack hold the memory address of the location in Heap.
```JavaScript
class Animal {}
// stores `new Animal()` instance on memory address 0x001232
// tiger has 0x001232 as value in stack
const tiger = new Animal()
// stores `new Object()` instance on memory address 0x000001
// `lion` has 0x000001 as value on stack
let lion = {
    strength: "Very Strong"
}
```
