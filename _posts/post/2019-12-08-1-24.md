## Part I. Computer Memory
---
### What is Computer Memory?
> It is like a human brain, a physical device where all datas are stored for temporary or permanent. 

## How do computer set data address into memory?
>A "bit" is a single binary digit the smallest unit of storage, which represent 0 or 1. A "byte" is 8 binary digits working together to represent a number that can take a value between 0 and upto 255 in the decimal system. 
Binary is nothing more than a system of counting. The 0s and 1s in binary represent OFF or ON respectively. In a [transistor](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/transistor), an "0" represents no flow of electricity, and "1" represents electricity being allowed to flow. In this way, numbers are represented physically inside the computing device, permitting calculation.<br>
Computer understand every data based on American Standard Code Information Interchange(ASCII).

`Example)`<br>
- For if you typed a letter B, your first letter would be 01000010. <br>
- If you type a word "dog", your letter would be 01100100 01101111 01100111. Please look at the ASCII reference below:

## Part II. JavaScript Memory Model

### What is JavaScript Memory?
> Memory is the space where the variable or value is stored. In other words, when your code is executed. I want you to think that your declared variables, functions, and statements are contained somewhere. This somewhere is known as a memory. After writting codes computer will not understand our code; therefore, there is a system known as compilor who will do the magic for computer to understand it. 

### Memory Model
> During JavaScript program execution, it assigned into three portions of memory. These combined portions is known as the **Address Space** of the program.
1.	**Code Area:** <br>  instructions
- This is the space where when the Javascript code is executed and being stored
2.	**Call Stack:** <br>
- In this space, the variables will be stored in the stack in a **LIFO method** and value date types will be stored here. It keeps track of currently executing functions, perform computation and store local variables.
3.	**Heap:** <br>
- Unlike stack, there is no LIFO policy. Instead, memory allocation is randomly placed. 
This space is where JavaScript reference data types being allocated. To prevent memory “holes” in the Heap, the JS engine has memory managers that prevent them from occurring.

`Example)` Call Stack
```JavaScript
let kit = 1
let dog = 3
```

`Example)` Heap
```JavaScript
class school {}
// stores `new school()` instance on memory address 0x001232
// student has 0x001232 as value in stack
const student = new school()
// stores `new Object()` instance on memory address 0x000001
// `teacher` has 0x000001 as value on stack
let teacher = {
    strength: "Very smart"
}
```
